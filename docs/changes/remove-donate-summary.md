# Donate UI Removal Summary (Prototype)

This document summarizes the prototype-only removal of the Donate UI.

Removed/Changed:
- Navigation tab `donate` removed from `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`.
- Deleted UI page: `app/(tabs)/donate.tsx`.
- Replaced user-facing occurrences of "Saheli" with "ResQ Connect" in UI/docs.

Notes:
- No backend/payment logic was altered. This change is strictly UI/docs.
- Prototype continues to function via `npm run demo` with no API keys.
