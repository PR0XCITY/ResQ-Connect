# Security Policy for ResQ Connect

## Overview

ResQ Connect is a safety-critical application that handles sensitive personal data, location information, and emergency communications. This document outlines our security practices and policies.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Measures

### API Key Management

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- Store all API keys in platform secrets (GitHub Secrets, Vercel Environment Variables, etc.)
- Use different keys for development, staging, and production environments
- Rotate keys regularly (every 90 days)
- Use minimal required scopes for each API key
- Monitor API key usage and set up alerts for unusual activity

### Data Protection

- **End-to-end encryption** for all sensitive data transmission
- **HMAC-SHA256** message signing for device communications
- **JWT tokens** with short expiration times for authentication
- **HTTPS only** for all API communications
- **No sensitive data** stored in client-side storage
- **Regular data purging** of old location and emergency data

### Network Security

- **Rate limiting** on all API endpoints
- **CORS** properly configured for allowed origins only
- **Input validation** and sanitization on all user inputs
- **SQL injection** prevention using parameterized queries
- **XSS protection** with proper content security policies
- **CSRF protection** for state-changing operations

### Device Security

- **Secure device pairing** with unique device certificates
- **OTA updates** with cryptographic verification
- **Tamper detection** and automatic alerting
- **Secure boot** and hardware security modules where possible
- **Regular firmware updates** with security patches

## Security Best Practices for Developers

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Proper error handling without information leakage
- [ ] Secure communication protocols (HTTPS, WSS)
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checks
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Logging without sensitive data exposure

### Development Environment

- Use `.env.example` as a template for environment variables
- Never commit `.env` files or actual secrets
- Use different API keys for development and production
- Enable all security features in development
- Test security measures as part of the development process

### Production Deployment

- Enable all security headers and HTTPS
- Use secure, up-to-date dependencies
- Implement proper monitoring and alerting
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Security Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring

- **API usage monitoring** for unusual patterns
- **Failed authentication attempts** tracking
- **Rate limiting violations** alerting
- **Error rate monitoring** for potential attacks
- **Dependency vulnerability** scanning

### Manual Reviews

- **Quarterly security audits** of the entire system
- **Penetration testing** by third-party security firms
- **Code reviews** focusing on security aspects
- **Infrastructure security** assessments

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

- **Critical**: Data breach, system compromise, emergency system failure
- **High**: Authentication bypass, privilege escalation, data exposure
- **Medium**: Information disclosure, denial of service
- **Low**: Minor vulnerabilities, configuration issues

### Response Procedures

1. **Immediate Response** (0-1 hour)
   - Assess the scope and impact
   - Contain the incident
   - Notify security team

2. **Investigation** (1-24 hours)
   - Gather evidence and logs
   - Identify root cause
   - Assess data impact

3. **Remediation** (1-7 days)
   - Apply fixes and patches
   - Update security measures
   - Monitor for recurrence

4. **Post-Incident** (1-30 days)
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security procedures
   - Notify affected users if required
