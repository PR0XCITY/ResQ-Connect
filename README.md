# üö® ResQ Connect

the world doesn't need another app. it needs trust. it needs safety. it needs **ResQ Connect**.  

we‚Äôve all seen women compromise freedom for safety‚Äîtaking longer routes, sharing live locations, clutching phones like lifelines. and yet, when danger strikes, tech usually reacts too late.  

ResQ Connect flips that. it's not just an app. it's a wearable dashcam, an ai safety network, and a donation engine all in one. built for travelers. built to protect. built to empower.

## what it is

a pin-sized device with a camera that works like a human dashcam.  
a mobile app that connects, alerts, and guides.  
an ecosystem that compounds into trust, community, and freedom.  

---

## how it works

the hardware is simple but powerful: esp32-cam with night vision, local storage, secure cloud uploads, a trust light to signal recording, a buzzer for sos, and haptic alerts when things go wrong.  

the mobile app completes the loop: start or stop recording, trigger sos with a tap or a voice, share live location, choose safer routes, and send alerts to trusted contacts.  

when sos goes off, family, friends, and even nearby ResQ Connect users get notified instantly. danger becomes visible. safety becomes collective.

## what makes it different

anyone can add an sos button. anyone can plot maps. anyone can build donation forms.  
but **ResQ Connect stacks what others separate**.  

- human dashcam with esp32-cam + night vision  
- safest route navigation powered by community ratings  
- fake call mode to deter attackers  
- ai noise detection for screams, panic words, ‚Äúbachao‚Äù  
- geo-fencing that alerts when entering unsafe zones  
- purchase-to-donation model: every 10 devices fund 1 for ngos  
- blockchain-backed ngo transparency with geotagged proof of delivery  

it‚Äôs not about fighting for the peak in one skill. it‚Äôs about owning the intersection. hardware + software + social movement.

## accessibility

safety should never depend on literacy or language.  
so ResQ Connect speaks through vibrations, haptics, and voice.  

- english at launch, hindi in the pipeline  
- voice input like "ResQ Connect, help me" to trigger sos  
- large-icon simplified ui for lower literacy users  
- distinct haptic patterns for sos, low battery, incoming calls  
- visual + audio alerts so nothing goes unnoticed  

---

## security & privacy

safety is useless without privacy. saheli protects both.  

- end-to-end encrypted cloud storage  
- local + cloud recording for redundancy  
- tamper-proof data transfers  
- full user control: delete whenever you choose

## social impact

this isn‚Äôt just tech‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement.  

every 10 purchases gift 1 device to an ngo.  
donors see geotagged proof of delivery, verified on blockchain.  
ngos share stories and updates back with the community.  
the app tracks your impact: *‚Äúyour purchase helped donate 0.1 of a device.‚Äù*  

safety becomes not just personal but communal.

## hackathon-ready prototype

phase 1 is app-only:  
use the phone camera as a stand-in, sos button, safe route navigation, donation module, ai noise detection simulated.  

phase 2 brings in hardware:  
esp32-cam pin with night vision, trust light, buzzer, haptic alerts, cloud uploads synced with the app.  

---

## the stack

react native with expo.  
typescript for structure.  
tailwind for styling.  
esp32-cam for wearable hardware.  
firebase/aws for cloud.  
maps + payments apis for navigation and donations.  
blockchain layer for ngo transparency.

## how to run

clone the repo.  
install dependencies.  
run it with expo.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Darshcmd/ResQConnect.git
cd ResQConnect
npm install
npx expo start
